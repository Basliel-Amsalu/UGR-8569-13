                    <p>Ever since the death of his father, the burden of supporting the family has fallen upon Tanjirou Kamado's shoulders. 
                        Though living impoverished on a remote mountain, the Kamado family are able to enjoy a relatively peaceful and happy life. 
                        One day, Tanjirou decides to go down to the local village to make a little money selling charcoal. On his way back, night falls, 
                        forcing Tanjirou to take shelter in the house of a strange man, who warns him of the existence of flesh-eating demons that lurk in the woods at night.
                        When he finally arrives back home the next day, he is met with a horrifying sight—his whole family has been slaughtered. 
                        Worse still, the sole survivor is his sister Nezuko, who has been turned into a bloodthirsty demon.</p>

                        The capture and execution of Roger by the World Government brought a change throughout the world. His last words before his death 
                        revealed the existence of the greatest treasure in the world, One Piece. It was this revelation that brought about the Grand Age of Pirates, 
                        men who dreamed of finding One Piece—which promises an unlimited amount of riches and fame—and quite possibly the pinnacle of glory and the

                        for intense training following events which fueled his desire to be stronger. Now Akatsuki, 
                        the mysterious organization of elite rogue ninja, is closing in on their grand plan which may 
                        threaten the safety of the entire shinobi world. Although Naruto is older and sinister events 
                        loom on the horizon, he has changed little in personality—still rambunctious and childish—though 
                        he is now far more confident and possesses an even greater determination to protect his friends and home.</p>

                    <p>Centuries ago, mankind was slaughtered to near extinction by monstrous humanoid creatures called Titans, 
                        forcing humans to hide in fear behind enormous concentric walls. What makes these giants truly 
                        terrifying is that their taste for human flesh is not born out of hunger but what appears to be out of pleasure. 
                        To ensure their survival, the remnants of humanity began living 
                        within defensive barriers, resulting in one hundred years without a single titan encounter.</p>
